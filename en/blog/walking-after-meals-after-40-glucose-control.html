      <p>If you want one low-effort habit that can improve body composition and energy after 40, start with this: <strong>walk 10–15 minutes after your biggest meals</strong>. You don’t need a gym, wearable, or perfect plan. You just need consistency.</p>

      <h2>Why post-meal walks work (especially after 40)</h2>
      <p>As we age, glucose handling often becomes less efficient. That can show up as afternoon crashes, stronger evening cravings, or fat loss stalls. Light walking after meals helps your muscles use circulating glucose, which can flatten the post-meal spike and reduce the “crash and snack” cycle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lower post-meal glucose peaks</li>
        <li>More stable energy between meals</li>
        <li>Better appetite control in the evening</li>
        <li>Extra daily calorie burn without recovery debt</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The 2-week starter plan</h2>
      <p>Keep it simple and realistic. Most people fail because they overbuild this.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Walk after one meal daily (preferably dinner), 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Add a second post-meal walk on 3–4 days, 10–15 minutes each.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Use a conversational pace. You should be able to breathe through your nose and talk in short sentences.</p>

      <h2>Best timing and intensity</h2>
      <p>Start your walk <strong>within 20–40 minutes after eating</strong>. You don’t need to rush out immediately. Avoid hard intervals right after large meals. Keep effort at easy-to-moderate intensity (RPE 3–5/10).</p>

      <h2>What to do if your schedule is chaotic</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Office days:</strong> 2 x 5-minute hallway or stair loops after lunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Home days:</strong> 12-minute neighborhood loop after dinner.</li>
        <li><strong>Rainy days:</strong> Indoor treadmill or marching circuit while listening to a podcast.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Micro-walks still count. Habit strength beats perfect conditions.</p>

      <h2>How this helps fat loss without burnout</h2>
      <p>Post-meal walks increase total daily movement (NEAT) while protecting recovery. That’s why they pair so well with strength training and moderate cardio.</p>
      <p>Use this stack:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2–3 strength sessions per week</li>
        <li>2 zone-2 sessions per week (optional longer cardio)</li>
        <li>1–2 post-meal walks per day</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This combination is sustainable and usually more effective than aggressive cardio bursts followed by exhaustion.</p>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Going too hard and turning every walk into a workout</li>
        <li>Skipping because you can’t do a “perfect” 30-minute session</li>
        <li>Ignoring dinner walks (often the highest leverage for cravings)</li>
        <li>Not tracking consistency for at least 14 days</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick weekly scorecard</h2>
      <p>Track these four metrics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number of post-meal walks completed</li>
        <li>Afternoon energy (1–10)</li>
        <li>Evening cravings (1–10)</li>
        <li>Waist trend or weekly weight average</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If consistency is high and energy is improving, keep going before changing anything else.</p>

        <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> If your energy and fat loss feel stuck, start with 10 minutes after dinner for 14 days. It’s one of the highest ROI habits for adults 40+ because it is easy to repeat and hard to overdo.</p>
