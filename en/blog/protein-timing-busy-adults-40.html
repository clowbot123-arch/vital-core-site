            <p class="intro">Many people over 40 hit the gym consistently but still under-eat protein at key times. The result is slower recovery, more cravings, and weaker training progression. The fix is not complicated: distribute protein across meals and keep post-workout intake predictable.</p>

            <h2>A practical daily target</h2>
            <p>A common evidence-based range for active adults is around <strong>1.6–2.2 g protein per kg body weight per day</strong>. You don’t need to hit the top end every day. Consistency in the middle of the range usually beats short bursts of perfection.</p>

            <h2>Meal-by-meal structure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> 30–40g protein (e.g., eggs + skyr, or cottage cheese bowl)</li>
                <li><strong>Lunch:</strong> 30–45g protein (meat/fish/tofu + legumes or whole grains)</li>
                <li><strong>Dinner:</strong> 30–45g protein</li>
                <li><strong>Optional snack:</strong> 20–30g if needed to reach your target</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Where supplements can help</h2>
            <p>Supplements are useful when your schedule is chaotic or appetite is low after training. In that case, a targeted amino support strategy can be practical. We break this down in our <a href="/en/products/advanced-amino-acid-complex.html">Advanced Amino Acid Complex review</a>, including who benefits most and who should skip it.</p>

            <h2>Energy still low despite good protein?</h2>
            <p>If protein intake is solid but energy remains flat, look at sleep quality, training volume, and stress first. Then evaluate options like our detailed <a href="/en/products/endopeak-vitality-formula.html">EndoPeak Vitality Formula guide</a> to see whether it matches your context.</p>

            <h2>Action plan for the next 7 days</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Set a realistic protein target in the 1.6–2.2 g/kg range.</li>
                <li>Pre-plan one high-protein breakfast and one high-protein lunch.</li>
                <li>Track adherence, not perfection (5 of 7 good days is progress).</li>
            </ol>
