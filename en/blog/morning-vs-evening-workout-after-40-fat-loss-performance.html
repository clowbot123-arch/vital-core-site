      <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> both morning and evening workouts can work after 40. The best time is the one you can keep for months while protecting sleep and keeping food choices under control.</p>

      <h2>Morning vs evening: what changes after 40?</h2>
      <h3>Morning training advantages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fewer schedule conflicts and fewer missed workouts</li>
        <li>Better daily momentum and decision quality around food</li>
        <li>Lower chance that stress cancels your session later</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Evening training advantages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher body temperature can improve strength output</li>
        <li>More fuel in the system for heavier sessions</li>
        <li>Can reduce post-work stress when timed early enough</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Decision framework: choose your best slot in 10 minutes</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Check adherence:</strong> which slot had fewer cancellations in the last 3 weeks?</li>
        <li><strong>Check sleep response:</strong> if late sessions hurt sleep, move hard training earlier.</li>
        <li><strong>Check appetite response:</strong> if evening sessions trigger overeating, shift key sessions to morning.</li>
        <li><strong>Match session type:</strong> heavy strength in your highest-energy slot, easy cardio where convenient.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Practical weekly plan (fat loss + performance)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>2-3 strength sessions:</strong> morning or late afternoon (not too close to bedtime)</li>
        <li><strong>2 Zone 2 sessions:</strong> 25-40 minutes at conversational pace</li>
        <li><strong>Daily movement:</strong> 8,000-11,000 steps + 10-minute post-meal walks</li>
        <li><strong>Protein anchor:</strong> include protein in the pre- or post-workout meal</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Changing workout time every week and never building rhythm</li>
        <li>Doing high-intensity sessions too late, then sleeping poorly</li>
        <li>Optimizing timing while ignoring protein, steps, and recovery</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Is morning training better for fat loss after 40?</h3>
      <p>Only if it improves consistency and appetite control for you. Fat loss still depends on weekly energy balance and sustainable habits.</p>

      <h3>Is evening training better for muscle and performance?</h3>
      <p>For many people, performance feels better later in the day. But if evening sessions reduce sleep, long-term progress can drop.</p>

      <h3>How late is too late to train?</h3>
      <p>If your sleep worsens, keep high-intensity or heavy training at least 2-3 hours before bedtime.</p>

      <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> after 40, the “best” workout time is the one that keeps your training consistent, your sleep stable, and your recovery predictable.</p>
