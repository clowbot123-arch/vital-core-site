            <p class="intro">The myth that muscle building becomes impossible after 40 needs to be debunked. Science shows us that with the right approach, building muscle is not only possible—it can be highly effective at any age.</p>

            <h2>Why Muscle Building Changes After 40</h2>
            <p>As we age, our bodies undergo several changes that affect muscle development:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hormonal changes:</strong> Testosterone and growth hormone levels naturally decline</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery time:</strong> Muscles need more time to repair between workouts</li>
                <li><strong>Protein synthesis:</strong> Becomes less efficient but still functional</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Science-Backed Approach</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Progressive Overload</h3>
            <p>This remains the golden rule of muscle building. Gradually increase the weight, reps, or sets over time. Start where you're comfortable and progress slowly.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Protein Intake</h3>
            <p>Your body needs more protein as you age. Current recommendations suggest:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1.6-2.2g per kg</strong> of body weight daily</li>
                <li>Spread across 3-4 meals</li>
                <li>Include high-quality sources: eggs, chicken, fish, legumes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Training Frequency</h3>
            <p>Training 2-3 times per week is optimal for most people over 40. This allows adequate recovery while providing enough stimulus for growth.</p>

            <h3>4. Sleep Quality</h3>
            <p>Muscle growth happens during sleep. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Poor sleep directly impacts your ability to build muscle.</p>

            <h2>Sample Weekly Routine</h2>
            <table style="width:100%; margin: 20px 0;">
                <tr style="background:#f0f0f0;"><th>Day</th><th>Focus</th><th>Exercises</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Monday</td><td>Upper Body</td><td>Push-ups, Rows, Shoulder Press</td></tr>
                <tr style="background:#f8f9fa;"><td>Wednesday</td><td>Lower Body</td><td>Squats, Lunges, Calf Raises</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Friday</td><td>Full Body</td><td>Combined exercises, Core work</td></tr>
            </table>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Start with lighter weights and focus on form</li>
                <li>✅ Prioritize protein intake throughout the day</li>
                <li>✅ Get adequate sleep for recovery</li>
                <li>✅ Be patient – results take time but are achievable</li>
                <li>✅ Consider working with a trainer to perfect your technique</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top:30px;"><strong>Remember:</strong> The best exercise is the one you'll actually do. Start today, stay consistent, and the results will follow.</p>
