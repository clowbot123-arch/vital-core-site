# Social Drafts - Steps Per Day After 40 (2026-02-17)

## X / Twitter
Most adults 40+ don't need extreme cardio to lose fat.

A better target:
• 7,500+ daily step floor
• 8,500-10,000 high-return range
• track weekly average, not one perfect day

Simple, sustainable, and recovery-friendly.

If fat loss feels harder after 40, start with your daily movement floor.

✅ 7,500+ steps/day = minimum effective baseline
✅ 8,500-10,000 = high-return range for most people
✅ Weekly consistency > all-or-nothing days

You don't need punishing cardio. Build repeatable habits.

One of the most overlooked fat-loss levers for adults over 40 is daily movement outside formal workouts.

A practical approach:
- establish a 7,500-step minimum floor
- progress toward 8,500-10,000 as recovery allows
- use post-meal 10-minute walks to improve consistency

This is often more sustainable than adding high-intensity sessions too early.
