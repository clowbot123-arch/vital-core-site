# Social Pack — Intermittent Fasting After 40 for Belly Fat

## X / Threads
Intermittent fasting after 40 can work for belly fat — but aggressive windows usually backfire.

A better start:
• Week 1: 12:12
• Week 2: 14:10
• Protein first meal (30–45g)
• 2–4 strength sessions/week

Simple + repeatable beats extreme.
