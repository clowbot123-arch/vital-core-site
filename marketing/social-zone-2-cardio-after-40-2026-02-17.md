# Social Drafts — Zone 2 Cardio After 40 (VitalCore)

## X / Threads
Most people over 40 don’t need harder cardio.
They need *repeatable* cardio.

Zone 2 (easy-moderate pace) is underrated for fat loss:
- easier recovery
- fewer skipped sessions
- better appetite control

If you can talk in short sentences, you’re close.

Start: 2x/week, 30-40 min.
Then build to 3x/week.

If fat loss after 40 feels harder than it used to, try this shift:

➡️ Less “all-out” cardio
➡️ More consistent Zone 2 sessions

Zone 2 is the pace where breathing is deeper, but you can still talk.
It helps you burn more calories each week *without* crushing recovery.

Simple plan:
• Week 1-2: 2 sessions x 30-40 min
• Week 3-4: 3 sessions x 35-45 min
• Keep strength training as priority

Consistency beats intensity spikes.
