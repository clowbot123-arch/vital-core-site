# Social Asset: Coffee Timing After 40

## X / LinkedIn Post
Most adults 40+ don't need less coffee — they need better timing.

Simple rule:
- First coffee: 60-90 min after waking
- Last coffee: 8-10h before bed

Result: better focus in the day, better sleep at night.

If you wake tired + crash at 3 PM, fix your caffeine window first.
