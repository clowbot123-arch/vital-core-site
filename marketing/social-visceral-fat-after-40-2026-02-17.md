# Social Pack — How to Lose Visceral Fat After 40

## X / Threads Post
Most people over 40 try to “lose belly fat” by cutting calories harder.

Better move: target **visceral fat** with a waist-first system:
- protein at every meal
- 8k–11k steps/day
- 2–4 strength sessions/week
- 7+ hours sleep
- 10-min post-meal walks

Simple. Repeatable. Effective.
