## X / Threads
Most adults 40+ don’t need harder workouts.
They need better blood sugar rhythm.

Try this for 14 days:
- 10–15 min walk after dinner
- conversational pace
- no perfection needed

Result: fewer crashes + fewer late-night cravings.

A short walk after eating can help flatten glucose spikes and reduce evening cravings — especially after 40.

✅ 10–15 minutes
✅ Start within 20–40 min after meals
✅ Keep it easy (you should still be able to talk)

Do this for 2 weeks before changing anything else.

One of the most underrated habits for adults 40+ is post-meal walking.

A 10–15 minute walk after meals is simple, low-stress, and sustainable. It supports better glucose handling, smoother energy, and often better adherence to fat-loss routines.

No special gear. No “all or nothing.” Just consistency.

I put together a practical implementation guide here:
