## 1) Q: "How can men over 40 lose belly fat without extreme dieting?"
Short answer: stop trying to out-diet poor recovery.

What works best for most men 40+ is a repeatable 4-part system:
1) Track waist weekly (not just scale weight)
2) Lift 3x/week (full body)
3) Hit protein + fiber first at meals
4) Protect sleep and reduce late-night snacking

If those 4 are consistent for 4–6 weeks, waist reduction usually follows even without crash dieting. This guide has a full implementation template:

You can also pair it with this protein target framework:

## 2) Q: "What should I do first for perimenopause weight gain after 40?"
Start with structure, not restriction.

The first 21 days should focus on:
- Protein floor (spread across 3–4 meals)
- Strength training as your anchor
- Daily low-stress movement (walking is enough)
- Sleep protection and evening craving control

Most women feel appetite and energy improvements before big scale changes. That’s still progress and usually predicts better long-term fat loss.

## 3) Q: "Why am I still tired after 40 even though I exercise?"
Because training alone can’t fix poor energy architecture.

Common bottlenecks:
- Under-eating protein early in the day
- Too much intensity, not enough recovery
- Sleep timing drift
- No meal timing strategy for glucose stability

Use a systems approach: symptom > root cause > one weekly adjustment. This practical hub maps it clearly:
