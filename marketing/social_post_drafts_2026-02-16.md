## 1) Quora Draft (Answer)
**Question idea:** "Why do I feel tired all the time after 40 even with enough sleep?"

**Draft answer:**
A lot of people 40+ focus only on sleep duration, but energy is usually a combination of sleep quality, blood sugar stability, hydration, and protein timing.

What helped most in practice:
1. Keep wake/sleep time consistent (even on weekends)
2. Eat protein in the first meal (25–35g)
3. Avoid huge sugar spikes at lunch
4. 10–15 min daylight + short walk in the morning
5. Caffeine cut-off 8 hours before bed
