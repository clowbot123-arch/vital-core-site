# Social Drafts — Carb Timing After 40 (2026-02-17)

## X / Twitter

Carbs are not the enemy after 40.
Bad timing is.

If fat loss stalled, try this simple shift:

• More carbs around training / active hours
• Fewer carbs in sedentary evening meals
• Keep protein high at every meal

You don’t need to remove carbs to lose fat after 40.
You need better placement.

✅ Put most carbs where they help performance (before/after workouts, active hours)
✅ Keep low-activity meals protein + fiber focused
✅ Avoid the “all carbs at night” pattern

I put together a practical, no-extremes framework here:

Save this for your next meal-prep day.

For adults 40+, carb timing often matters more than carb elimination.

A practical pattern we use:
1) Place more carbs around training and high-output hours
2) Keep sedentary meals more protein/fiber-forward
3) Use consistent protein anchors to control appetite

This improves adherence, energy stability, and long-term fat-loss outcomes.
