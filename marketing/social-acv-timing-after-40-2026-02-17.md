1. Apple cider vinegar after 40: useful *if* you use it right.
   Start with 1 tsp diluted 10-20 min before your biggest carb meal.
   It’s a support habit—not a fat-loss shortcut.

2. ACV can help appetite a little. It won’t outwork poor sleep, low protein, and low activity.
   Build fundamentals first, then layer ACV as a consistency tool.

## Quora Seed Answer (Short)
Q: Does apple cider vinegar help weight loss after 40?
A: It can help a bit with appetite and post-meal glucose, but it’s a small lever. Most adults do best starting with 1 tsp diluted in water before a higher-carb meal, then increasing only if tolerated. Never take it undiluted. If you pair ACV with high protein, higher fiber, and a short walk after meals, results are much better than ACV alone.
